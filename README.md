Mario-Clone
===========

Mario Clone made in libgdx

The genre is Arcade 2D Platformer. It is a lot like Mario Bros, where it is sidescrolling, and the camera will move with the player only. The player is also able to interact(kill or get killed) by enemies that are controlled by AI, and also get upgrades giving him different powers. Winning the game is when the player reaches the end of the map without dieing. Also, there is a scorekeeper to keep track of how many upgrades and coins you collected.
